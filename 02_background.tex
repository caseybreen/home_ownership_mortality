A handful of studies have suggested that owning a home in the U.S. is associated with better health and mortality outcomes. While there has been no causal evidence that home ownership is associated with longer longevity, there are several compelling theoretical pathways suggesting that this relationship is causal. 

First, homeowners stay longer in a unit than their renter counterparts~\citep{rohe_homeownership_1996-1}. This promotes promotes stronger social networks and community, a known determinant of lower mortality. Further, these stronger social networks are associated with higher social capital, among low and moderate income households. A large body of work has connected social network and social support to mortality outcomes~\citep{cobb_social_1976, berkman_emotional_1992, berkman_social_1979, smith_social_2008}. We also hypothesize that homeownership can facilitate the investment in human capital relevant to health, such as stronger relationships with primary physicians. 

Second, homeownership is a key vessel for wealth accumulation in the U.S. during this time. While there is substantial heterogeneity in the financial returns of homeownership by timing of purchase, location of purchase, and length of ownership, there are several ways in which homeownership helps accumulate wealth. First, homes themselves appreciate in value. Second, homeowners enjoy tax benefits in the form of tax deductions of on mortgage interest and no capital gains taxes. Finally, homeownership plays an important role in retirement savings, as homeowners don't access equity directly rather the rent-free use of the property. 

Third, homeowners are at lower risk than renters of health issues brought about from substandard housing. The quality of housing for renters is generally considered to be lower than for ownership. Substandard housing effects mortality through infectious disease, such as lack of clean drinking water, higher exposure to insects and rats, and overcrowding, all factors that can lead to higher risk of infectious disease mortality. Additionally, there is some evidence that damp, cold conditions can lead to lower mental health. 

Fourth, owning a home is associated with general feelings of security. Knowing neighborhoods can help people avoid crime and violence.
