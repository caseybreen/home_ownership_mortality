  abstract = {Does education change people's lives in a way that delays mortality? Or is education primarily a proxy for unobserved endowments that promote longevity? Most scholars conclude that the former is true, but recent evidence based on Danish twin data calls this conclusion into question. Unfortunately, these potentially field-changing findings\textemdash that obtaining additional schooling has no independent effect on survival net of other hard-to-observe characteristics\textemdash have not yet been subject to replication outside Scandinavia. In this article, we produce the first U.S.-based estimates of the effects of education on mortality using a representative panel of male twin pairs drawn from linked complete-count census and death records. For comparison purposes, and to shed additional light on the roles that neighborhood, family, and genetic factors play in confounding associations between education and mortality, we also produce parallel estimates of the education-mortality relationship using data on (1) unrelated males who lived in different neighborhoods during childhood, (2) unrelated males who shared the same neighborhood growing up, and (3) non-twin siblings who shared the same family environment but whose genetic endowments vary to a greater degree. We find robust associations between education and mortality across all four samples, although estimates are modestly attenuated among twins and non-twin siblings. These findings\textemdash coupled with several robustness checks and sensitivity analyses\textemdash support a causal interpretation of the association between education and mortality for cohorts of boys born in the United States in the first part of the twentieth century.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: This study examined whether living in rented housing is associated with increased all-cause and cause-specific mortality, and whether the association between home ownership and mortality can be explained by household income, occupational class, and educational level. METHODS: A random sample including every seventh Finn aged 40-80 years at the end of 1997 (N = 308 291) was derived from the population register of Finland. The sample was followed up for mortality until the end of 2003 during which time there were 22,721 deaths. RESULTS: The hazard ratio for all-cause mortality among renters compared with owner-occupiers was 2.06 (95\% CI 1.98 to 2.14) in men and 1.73 (1.65 to 1.81) in women. Adjusting for household income, occupational class, and educational level attenuated the excess mortality among renters by 30\% in men and 19\% in women. The effect of income was larger among the under 65 year olds than those aged 65 years or over. Excess mortality among renters was particularly high for alcohol-related diseases, respiratory diseases, lung cancer, as well as endocrine, metabolic and nutritional diseases, and infections. CONCLUSIONS: Renters had higher mortality than owner-occupiers even after adjusting for household income, occupational class, and educational level. Home ownership may indicate material living standards and cumulative wealth that cannot sufficiently be captured by conventional socioeconomic indicators. Analysing home ownership may thus increase understanding of the factors producing inequalities in health.},

For low-income, vulnerable households there are particular challenges in creating a sense of home in a new tenancy which may have substantial effects on health and wellbeing. This study examines the role of these less tangible aspects of the housing experience for tenants in the social and private rented sectors in west central Scotland.},
