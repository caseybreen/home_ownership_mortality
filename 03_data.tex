The data from this study comes from the CenSoc-DMF file~\citep{goldstein_censoc_2021}, which links the IPUMS 1940 Census~\citep{ruggles_ipums_2020} and the mortality records from the Social Security Death Master File, a collection of over 83 million death records reported to the Social Security Administration between 1975 and 2005. This matched file includes only men, as surname changes at marriage for women present challenges for accurate linkage. We limit our analysis to the birth cohorts of 1905-1915. The 1940 Census was the first to collect information on housing. 

To identify siblings, we link men back to their 1920 Census records. This allows us to identify brothers who lived together in the same household in 1920. We use this sibling-based design to control for the hard-to-measure characteristics of early childhood and parental wealth~\citep{halpern-manners_effects_2020}. Our full sample contained over 2 million American men, and our sibling sample contained over 40,000 sibling pairs.\footnote{We restrict our analysis to household heads to exclude, for example, adult children who live with their parents. }
