For our PAA paper, we plan to apply to use our approach for the
analysis of doubly-truncated mortality data to several existing
research projects, including sibling analysis of mortality, changes in
the effects of education from one cohort to the next, and the analysis
of the effect of date of birth (with covariates like temperature). We
have already carried out some of these these analyses using the approach of
regressing on age at death and will explore how the results differ
using the approach that accounts for truncation.

We also hope to develop an R package that will make it easier for
researchers to use the same modeling syntax they use for linear regression
to instead carry out a truncated analysis.
