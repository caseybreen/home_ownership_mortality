  abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To compare the survival of elderly patients hospitalized for acute myocardial infarction who have emotional support with that of patients who lack such support, while controlling for severity of disease, comorbidity, and functional status. DESIGN: A prospective, community-based cohort study. SETTING: Two hospitals in New Haven, Connecticut. PATIENTS: Men (n = 100) and women (n = 94) 65 years of age or more hospitalized for acute myocardial infarction between 1982 and 1988. MEASUREMENTS: Social support, age, gender, race, education, marital status, living arrangements, presence of depression, smoking history, weight, and physical function were assessed prospectively using questionnaires. The presence of congestive heart failure, pulmonary edema, and cardiogenic shock; the position of infarction; in-hospital complications; and history of myocardial infarction were assessed using medical records. Comorbidity was defined using an index based on the presence of eight conditions. RESULTS: Of 194 patients, 76 (39\%) died in the first 6 months after myocardial infarction. In multiple logistic regression analyses, lack of emotional support was significantly associated with 6-month mortality (odds ratio, 2.9; 95\% CI, 1.2 to 6.9) after controlling for severity of myocardial infarction, comorbidity, risk factors such as smoking and hypertension, and sociodemographic factors. CONCLUSIONS: When emotional support was assessed before myocardial infarction, it was independently related to risk for death in the subsequent 6 months.},

This paper uses IPUMS data to study trends in racial differences in home ownership since 1900. At the turn of the century approximately 20 percent of black adult males (ages 20 to 64) owned their homes, compared with 46 percent of white men, a gap of 26 percentage points. By 1990, the black home ownership rate had increased to 52 percent and the racial gap had fallen to 19.5 percentage points. All of the long-term rise in the rate of black home ownership, and almost all of the corresponding long-term decline in the racial gap, occurred after 1940, with the majority of both changes concentrated in the 1960 to 1980 period. We also use the IPUMS to study trends in race differences in the incidence of mortgages, and in the value of owner-occupied housing.},

Most scholars conclude that the former is true, but recent evidence based on Danish twin data calls this conclusion into question. Unfortunately, these potentially field-changing findings\textemdash that obtaining additional schooling has no independent effect on survival net of other hard-to-observe characteristics\textemdash have not yet been subject to replication outside Scandinavia. In this article, we produce the first U.S.-based estimates of the effects of education on mortality using a representative panel of male twin pairs drawn from linked complete-count census and death records. For comparison purposes, and to shed additional light on the roles that neighborhood, family, and genetic factors play in confounding associations between education and mortality, we also produce parallel estimates of the education-mortality relationship using data on (1) unrelated males who lived in different neighborhoods during childhood, (2) unrelated males who shared the same neighborhood growing up, and (3) non-twin siblings who shared the same family environment but whose genetic endowments vary to a greater degree. We find robust associations between education and mortality across all four samples, although estimates are modestly attenuated among twins and non-twin siblings. These findings\textemdash coupled with several robustness checks and sensitivity analyses\textemdash support a causal interpretation of the association between education and mortality for cohorts of boys born in the United States in the first part of the twentieth century.},

Addressing housing issues offers public health practitioners an opportunity to address an important social determinant of health. Public health has long been involved in housing issues. In the 19th century, health officials targeted poor sanitation, crowding, and inadequate ventilation to reduce infectious diseases as well as fire hazards to decrease injuries. Today, public health departments can employ multiple strategies to improve housing, such as developing and enforcing housing guidelines and codes, implementing ``Healthy Homes'' programs to improve indoor environmental quality, assessing housing conditions, and advocating for healthy, affordable housing. Now is the time for public health to create healthier homes by confronting substandard housing.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: This study examined whether living in rented housing is associated with increased all-cause and cause-specific mortality, and whether the association between home ownership and mortality can be explained by household income, occupational class, and educational level. METHODS: A random sample including every seventh Finn aged 40-80 years at the end of 1997 (N = 308 291) was derived from the population register of Finland. The sample was followed up for mortality until the end of 2003 during which time there were 22,721 deaths. RESULTS: The hazard ratio for all-cause mortality among renters compared with owner-occupiers was 2.06 (95\% CI 1.98 to 2.14) in men and 1.73 (1.65 to 1.81) in women. Adjusting for household income, occupational class, and educational level attenuated the excess mortality among renters by 30\% in men and 19\% in women. The effect of income was larger among the under 65 year olds than those aged 65 years or over. Excess mortality among renters was particularly high for alcohol-related diseases, respiratory diseases, lung cancer, as well as endocrine, metabolic and nutritional diseases, and infections. CONCLUSIONS: Renters had higher mortality than owner-occupiers even after adjusting for household income, occupational class, and educational level. Home ownership may indicate material living standards and cumulative wealth that cannot sufficiently be captured by conventional socioeconomic indicators. Analysing home ownership may thus increase understanding of the factors producing inequalities in health.},

  abstract = {This research explores whether homeownership leads to increased individual social capital among low- to moderate-income families. Social capital refers to social resources a person can access through contacts with others in his or her social networks. We theorize that homeownership can motivate interactions with others in one's neighborhood and therefore build social capital. Using a sample of low- and moderate-income homeowners and a matched sample of renters, we collect data on overall social resources and neighborhood-specific social resources. We find that homeowners have more total social capital resources and more neighborhood social capital resources than renters. Neighborhood group involvement has an indirect effect on social capital, but explains only a small amount of the influence of homeownership. These findings hold when controlling for household-level and neighborhood-level sociodemographic variables, as well as when using statistical models that account for endogeneity. Based on this evidence, we conclude that homeownership gives people access to social capital via increased social ties to others. We discuss the implications of this finding for housing policy and suggest new directions for research on social capital.},

We present a conceptual model linking homeownership to health, highlighting key potential pathways. Using the Detroit Metropolitan Area as a case study, and data from the American Community Survey (2009\textendash 2013; 5-years estimates) and Michigan Department of Community Health, we tested the following questions: (1) Is neighborhood percentage non-Hispanic Black (NHB) associated with homeownership? (2) Is neighborhood percentage NHB associated with health? (3) Is the association between percentage NHB and health mediated by homeownership? (4) Does neighborhood housing value modify associations between percentage NHB and health, or between homeownership and health? Percentage NHB was associated with homeownership and health outcomes; Associations between percentage NHB and mortality, but not disability, were partially mediated by neighborhood homeownership. Neighborhood housing value modified associations between neighborhood homeownership and both disability and mortality, but not between percentage NHB and health outcomes. Findings are consistent with the thesis that health-promoting effects of homeownership may be contingent upon house values. These results add to a limited body of evidence suggesting that variations in homeownership may contribute to persistent racial and socioeconomic health inequities.},

This article questions convention by presenting a conceptual model of how homeownership rates might affect various indicators of neighborhood stability and by determining whether there is support for this model in the literature. The article also presents an original analysis of the relationship between homeownership rates and two measures of neighborhood stability. The literature review finds considerable support for an association between homeownership and both improved property maintenance and longer lengths of tenure. The analysis of census data similarly indicates less residential mobility and greater property value appreciation in areas with greater home-ownership. Although initial values and citywide value changes appear to have much stronger effects on changes in property values than the tract home-ownership rate, modest changes in homeownership rates are clearly associated with increased property values.},
