\begin{itemize}
    \item Researchers don't need to despair if they don't have all of the data they need.
    
    \item regression will underestimate effects.
    
    \item Old age mortality is systematic enough that it can be well described parametrically with Gompertz model, which allows MLE.
    
    \item the estimates we obtain are consistent in simulation, in the CenSoc data, and with published estimates using fuller data.
    
    \item We do not solve fundamental APC problem. So truncation still is a challenge even with good estimates.
    
    \item Caveats: (1) big assumption is that data is representaitve; (2) although the approach works in theory for non-proportinal hazards (e.g., varying slopes of gomeprtz), our analysis here is resetrict to PH. extending the software and analysis remains to be done (3) sib fixed effects. Departure from Gompertz ... younger ages and older ages ... also could be studied (cite Monica).
