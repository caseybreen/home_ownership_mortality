We use novel administrative data to measure the association between home ownership and longevity in the US. We then use a sibling-based
identification strategy to estimate the causal effect of home ownership on longevity, finding owning a home has a causal effect of over half a year on longevity While we must make several assumptions to imbue our estimates with a causal interpretation, our findings do suggest that home ownership likely has a causal effect on longevity. Our final paper will extend this preliminary analysis in three ways. First, we will look at racial difference in longevity returns to home ownership. Second, we will look at the interaction of home ownership and social status to better understand which population subgroups receive the largest longevity returns to home ownership. Finally, we will explore potential causal pathways -- such as wealth accumulation -- that explain the effect of home ownership on longevity.
