Our main results is shown in Figure~\ref{fig:home_ownership_models}. We observe a clear positive association between home ownership and longevity in our baseline model. Owning a home in 1940 is associated with a mortality advantage of 0.74 years. When we adjust for covariates (education, race, occupation, and urbanicity), the results are slightly attenuated: the mortality advantage is 0.72 years. When we include sibling fixed effects to account for shared conditions in childhood, genetics, and other hard-to-measure confounders, we still see a statistically significant mortality advantage of 0.52 years.
