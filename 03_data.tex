The data for this study comes from the CenSoc-DMF file~\citep{goldstein_censoc_2021}, which links the IPUMS 1940 Census~\citep{ruggles_ipums_2020} and the mortality records from the Social Security Death Master File (DMF). The DMF is a collection of over 83 million death records reported to the Social Security Administration between 1975 and 2005. Our analysis is restricted to only men, as surname changes at marriage for women present challenges for accurate linkage. We limit our analysis to the birth cohorts of 1905-1915, who were approximately 25 to 35 when they were enumerated in the 1940 census.

To identify siblings, we link men in the 1940 Census back to their 1920 Census records. This allows us to identify brothers who lived together in the same household in 1920. We use this sibling-based design to control for the hard-to-measure characteristics of early childhood and parental wealth~\citep{halpern-manners_effects_2020}. This process is outline in~\cref{fig:sample_timelines}. Our full sample contained over 2 million American men, and our sibling sample contained over 40,000 sibling pairs. We restrict our analysis to household heads to exclude adult children who live with their parents.
